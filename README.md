# Horiseon

## Purpose
A website that offers online business optimization services. 

## Description
Upon opening the original code from the website, the site lacked proper semantics, a confusing layout of CSS variables, and incomplete linking to various portions of the website. The task of this assignment was to refractor the code provided into a functional, readable, and more organized website all the while maintaining the same layout as the mock up screen shot provided.
